Files in Features are Raw Features without any labels. The Label is same as the filename and the assigned label must be concatenated infront of each feature vector.

eg. [raw_features] must be changed to [label raw_features] before trainning of the classifers.

In case you find feature vector to be of size 18 please run the Feature extract function by passing the corresponding parsed/Windowed Signal to obtain the new features
